## Guidelines for Evaluating Performance in a Chart Scenario:

- Create React App (CRA) has already been set up with a TypeScript template. In case you want to create a CRA(typescript template) using the following command:
### `npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`

- Navigate to the directory where the CRA is located, typically in Performance\CRA\my-app, and execute the following commands to set up dependencies:
### `yarn install`

- Start the development server by running:
### `yarn start`

- Copy the specific scenario you wish to assess into the App.tsx file. Refer to the provided sample file for guidance.

- Access the application in your browser by visiting http://localhost:3000.

- Utilize the Lighthouse tool to measure the performance of your scenario. For more details on using Lighthouse you can refer [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/lighthouse).
